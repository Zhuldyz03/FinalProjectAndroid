Our project is a process of ordering food from a local restaurant or food cooperation through internet. 
A customer will search for e restaurant, usually filtered via type of cuisine. \
**We built a food ordering application with the following functionalities:** 
1. A ‘Welcome page’ which displays the logo and name of the app.
2. A ‘Login Page’ which asks for users’ mobile number and password.
3. A ‘Registration Page’ which enables users to sign up for the app.
4. A ‘My Profile’ page (where the user’s name, phone number, and address is displayed).
5. A ‘Favorites’ page (where the list of all favourite restaurants is displayed).
6. An ‘Order History’ page which lists the previously placed orders of the user.
7. An ‘FAQ’ page which lists some frequently asked questions.
8. A ‘Logout’ functionality which takes the user to the login page.
9. A ‘Restaurant Details’ page which displays the menu items of that particular restaurant, each item’s price and the option to add an item to cart.
10. A ‘Cart’ which lists the items added to cart and the total amount to be paid. \
